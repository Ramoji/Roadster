Important InformationPlease note for security reasons all 3rd party API access keys have been omitted in `CypherHelper.swift` file, which renders the `NearByViewController.swift` unable to call the Yelp APIs . In order to make this application fully functional you must create your own Yelp API access keys and use it in conjunction with this app. Furthermore, the backend application access keys have also been left out for security reasons. Consequently, creating accounts and signing into user accounts on this version of the application is not possible.Some `@IBAction` methods, specifically the ones dealing with resetting users’ password, sending new rest stop locations to the developer have been intentionally left blank for security reasons.To get a feel of how this application functions with valid API keys, I have included gifs of various tabs.Gif 1: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o752jtY8809TlLbri/giphy.gifGif 2: https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8PygSdHZiVWkLe/giphy.gifGif 3: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc1aD7rgZoRj1YgE/giphy.gifGif 4: https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8KoepbTg34tjtS/giphy.gifGif 5: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc0WCeK3sU98qvZK/giphy.gifGif 6: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc0WGkIpWVsPFzZ6/giphy.gifGif 7: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc11J48QEw3h6DwA/giphy.gifPlease do no hesitate to ask any question you may have :)
