Important Information. Please read completely.

- Roadster is a road trip navigation app that shows the user the nearest rest stop and camping grounds out of nearly 4000 locations in the lower 48 states. Roadster also allows the user to rate and leave a public comment on rest stops. Furthermore, the user can search for places of interest such as grocery stores, gas station, coffee shops etc. The user can also search for addresses and navigate to them using this application. 
- Please note for security reasons all 3rd party API access keys have been omitted in `CypherHelper.swift` file, which renders the `NearByViewController.swift` unable to call the Yelp APIs . In order to make this application fully functional you must create your own Yelp API access keys and use it in conjunction with this app. Furthermore, the backend application access keys have also been left out for security reasons. Consequently, creating accounts and signing into user accounts on this version of the application is not possible.- Some `@IBAction` methods, specifically ones dealing with resetting user's password, and sending new rest stop locations to the developer, have been intentionally left blank for security reasons.

- This version of the application does not support the iPhone X / iOS 11 `SafeAreaLayoutGuide`. I will commit changes in the next two weeks to support the new layout guide features of iOS 11 / iPhone X.- To get a feel of how this application functions with valid API keys, I have included gifs of various tabs.Gif 1: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o752jtY8809TlLbri/giphy.gifGif 2: https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8PygSdHZiVWkLe/giphy.gifGif 3: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc1aD7rgZoRj1YgE/giphy.gifGif 4: https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8KoepbTg34tjtS/giphy.gifGif 5: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc0WCeK3sU98qvZK/giphy.gifGif 6: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc0WGkIpWVsPFzZ6/giphy.gifGif 7: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc11J48QEw3h6DwA/giphy.gif- Please do no hesitate to ask any question you may have :)
